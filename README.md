# ABOUT C++ OBJECT ORIENTED
<P>We know, c++ is superset of c but it has supported Object Oriented programming(OOP)<br />
Other language like java,javascript,python,ruby etc  has rich library as same  rich library support in c++ .<br />
But c++ is learn to hard cause it is also support  both low level and high level programming.<br/>
Nw we some code give in (OOP) class and object.<br />
Class is a user defind data type and object is a class variable.<br/>
